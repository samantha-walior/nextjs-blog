Favorite Teams and Gymnasts to Watch:

- **Florida Gators** (Runners Up last year by the slimmest of margins!)
    - [Trinity Thomas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzSG3RyPrHg) FLOATS that double layout!

- **LSU Tigers**
    - [Haleigh Bryant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogT6-pszkzA) with the best vault in the NCAA, hands down

- **Bama Crimson Tide**
    - [Luisa Blanco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZqp62u728I) is a dream with her high toe work and attention to detail

- **Oklahoma Sooners** - 2022 NCAA Champions (though you could argue UF deserved it)
    - [Audrey Davis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy1uncYsUeA) is perfection on the uneven bars every. single.time.

- **Other Gymnasts**
    - [Norah Flatley, Arkansas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxLwa2zGO0M): Formerly UCLA, transferred to Arkansas for her Graduate year.. mesmerizing artistry on Floor
    - [Sunisa Lee, Auburn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3fYREuCfZw): Olympic All Around Gold Medalist and proud Minnesotan!
    - [Jade Carey, Oregon State](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqm6PuDOy2M): Another Olympic gold medalist on floor, but a great vaulter as well
    - [Mya Hooten, Minnesota](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZiu-A9wTVg): A few 10s under her belt, and a natural performer with this choreography
    - [Libby Orman, Arizona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYdLSydbU9o): bit of a biased opinion, but I've coached her since she was 14, and choreograph all her routines!
